# Cook Book

## Description
As someone who has more recently taken a liking to cooking and spending time in the kitchen, I constantly find myself frustrated that I don't have my recipes all in one location. They are either saved away on a bookmark tab deep on my computer or hidden on some shelf within a cookbook. I really wanted a place to contain and combine all of my favorite recipes that is easily accesible by computer and phone. This web application aims to provide exactly that. I am combining React, GraphQL, MongoDB, and a host of other frameworks to accomplish this task. At the current moment, this is a passion project both for its functionality and also to learn new development processes, frameworks, and languages.
